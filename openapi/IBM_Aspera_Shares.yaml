    Complete API documentation for Aspera Shares, a secure file sharing and collaboration platform.

    In case of doubt, refer to the [official IBM Aspera Shares API reference](https://developer.ibm.com/apis/catalog/aspera--aspera-shares-api).

    This API provides comprehensive access to:
    - Files operations
    - Transfer authorizations
    - User and Group management
    - Shares and access control
    - Node operations
    - Administrative functions

    ## Authentication

    The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication.
    Include your credentials in the Authorization header:

    ```
    Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
    ```

    ## Base URLs

    - `/node_api` - API for file and transfer operation. A subset of HSTS Node API.
    - `/api/v1` - API for Administration.

      To create users, refer to Local User Management, SAML User Management, or LDAP User Management.
      However, delete occurs under Authorizable Users although you can also delete local users from Local User Management.
      It is important to note that only when the user type is database will the `local_user_id` be returned.

      > NOTE: Manager authorization to these resources depends on the configuration option selected in the UI.
