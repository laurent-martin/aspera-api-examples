      Use /clients to register your client application with the Files API. You
      can also modify your client, retrieve a list of all registered clients or
      a specific client, or delete a specific client. You can configure your
      client to use browser-based authentication or JSON web token (JWT)
      authentication.  For clients using JWT authentication, this endpoint
      relates to /client_authorizations.
    name: /clients
  - description: >-
      When you use the JWT authentication method for your client (see /clients)
      and enable a whitelist of authorized users or groups, you must configure
      which users or groups can access the API using your client, and which type
      of key each user can submit to retrieve an access token–either a
      user-specific key or a global key. Use the /client_authorizations endpoint
      to configure the authorized users or groups; use the /users endpoint to
      configure the user key types; use the /clients endpoint to configure the
      global key. There are two configuration parameters for users and keys.
      Users: All users: All users in the AoC organization are eligible to
      retrieve an access token; Only listed users: Only the users or groups you
      list are eligible to receive an access token. Keys: User-specific keys:
      The JWT must be signed with the specified user's own private key;
      User-specific keys and global key: The JWT can be signed with the
      specified user's own private key or with the global private key. Note: Any
      user accessing the AoC API using the JWT method must have their public key
      listed in their AoC user record. The user can enter their own public key,
      or the AoC administrator can enter the user's public key in the individual
      user's record. Important! API clients with a global key can retrieve
      access tokens for and act as any listed user. Use global keys according to
      local site security practice.

      Create a workspace (requires an admin token). The workspace is a distinct
      context in which workspace members can freely share files and send
      packages. All workspace users of the same type (for example, members or
      workspace managers) share collaboration settings for that user type. A
      workspace is a folder on a specific node; the workspace storage is
      separate from the storage of other workspaces. The workspace contains
      member users and groups. A workspace may have a workspace manager, who is
      also a workspace member, that can perform certain administrative function
      for that specific workspace. (Configure workspace manager using
      /workspace_memberships).
    name: /workspaces
  - description: >-
      Use this endpoint to add existing users as members of a workspace, and to
      update, retrieve, and delete workspace members. An Aspera on Cloud user
      can be a direct member of a workspace, or can inherit membership by being
      a member of a user group that is a member of the workspace. This endpoint
      allows you to add a user or group as a direct member of a workspace. You
      can also use this endpoint to grant or revoke workspace manager permission
      to a member (user or group).
    name: /workspace_memberships
  - description: >-
      A package is a bundle of files and folders (like a ZIP file or TAR file)
      specified by an AoC user to send to designated recipients. Packages can be
      sent to individuals, to groups (including to a workspace), or to shared
      inboxes. Packages can  be sent, received, recalled, archived, deleted.
      Sending a package can be completed with a user token or with an admin
      token. The process of sending a package comprises multiple steps. You use
      the POST, GET, and PUT methods of /packages, along with requests to the
      Connect API or the Node API.  The folder structure of a package on disk is
      as follows: {id}.asp-package contains metadata and other package-related
      files and contains contents, which contains the files and folders in the
      package. Uploads of package contents should go directly into the named,
      innermost folder. Downloads of the entire package should be of the named,
      outermost folder (renamed on download to the package name itself). To get
      package transfers to properly register, they should be tagged as follows:
      {"aspera": {"files": {"package_id" : the-package-id}}}.

      A user is anybody using this service. Users may be organization
      administrators, workspace managers, photographers, IT, etc. Users are
      identified by email address, so 'email' is a required property when
      creating a new user.
    name: /users
  - name: /nodes
    description: >
      The Nodes resource contains the information that a client app can use to
      communicate directly with an Aspera transfer server (which has files and
      folders).
  - description: >
      A shared inbox (formerly called a dropbox) serves three functions. First,
      it acts as a place where users can submit content. Second, it notifies its
      members when new content arrives. Finally, it can ask users who submit new
      content to fill out a form using a metadata schema.
    name: /dropboxes
  - description: >
      Use this endpoint to add existing members to a dropbox and to update,
      retrieve, and delete existing dropbox members. An Aspera on Cloud user can
      be a direct member of a dropbox or they can inherit membership through a
      user group.

  - name: /usage_reports
    description: >
      When enabled, usage reporting collects information about the number of
      bytes transferred into and out of an organization, on a per-workspace or
      per-access key basis. A report begins at the start of a month (or when
      usage reporting is enabled) and ends at the beginning of the next month,
      when a new report is created. An active report for the current month
      shows  month-to-date usage information, while usage reports for previous
      months no longer change and show historical data. Due to the way the
      reporting information is collected, the number of bytes transferred is an
      approximation and may vary from the actual billed usage if there are
      transfers that are close to or spanning the changeover between months.
      NOTE: Usage reports are read-only resources and all attributes are
      read-only.
  - name: /organizations
    description: >
      An organization contains all the users, groups, and resources belonging to
      a real-world organization. Users within an organization can see only the
      organization they are in. Organization admins can change certain
      properties of the organization. All other users within the organization
      have read-only access. Note: /organization is an alias to
      /organizations/{current user's organization id}.
  - description: >
      This endpoint is used to manage existing transfer node access keys.
      Specifically, it streamlines the task of viewing all access keys across
      all transfer nodes that belong to your organization. Note that this
      endpoint is not capable of creating or destroying transfer node access
      keys (that is handled via the Node API). Organization admin or workspace
      manager permissions are required for any access to this endpoint.
    name: /client_access_keys

      The /apps/app_memberships endpoint is useful for organization admins that
      want to enable users to access the Automation or Activity apps.
      Additionally, this endpoint is useful for admins who want to view all app
      memberships across their entire organization, or for any other user to
      view their own app memberships.
