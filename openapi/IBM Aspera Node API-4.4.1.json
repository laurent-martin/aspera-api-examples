If the FASP transfer is stopped abruptly, no usage information is retained. To get transfer rates for a specific transfer as time series data, use /ops/transfers/bandwidth. Authentication with Node API credentials allows you to retrieve usage for the node user. If an access key is also provided as a query, the response is the same as for access key authentication. Authentication with a master access key ID and secret allows you to retrieve usage associated with the access key, including usage by all usage IDs, aggregate usage for the access key and any sub-access keys, and usage by access key (for sub-access keys). Authentication with a sub-access key allows you to retrieve only usage data associated with the sub-access key (no data by usage IDs or aggregate data). Authentication with a bearer token allows you to retrieve usage data for the associated access key only if the bearer token has an admin scope-role.
