You can also modify your client, retrieve a list of all registered clients or a specific client, or delete a specific client. You can configure your client to use browser-based authentication or JSON web token (JWT) authentication.  For clients using JWT authentication, this endpoint relates to /client_authorizations.","name":"/clients"},{"description":"When you use the JWT authentication method for your client (see /clients) and enable a whitelist of authorized users or groups, you must configure which users or groups can access the API using your client, and which type of key each user can submit to retrieve an access tokenâ€“either a user-specific key or a global key. Use the /client_authorizations endpoint to configure the authorized users or groups; use the /users endpoint to configure the user key types; use the /clients endpoint to configure the global key. There are two configuration parameters for users and keys. Users: All users: All users in the AoC organization are eligible to retrieve an access token; Only listed users: Only the users or groups you list are eligible to receive an access token. Keys: User-specific keys: The JWT must be signed with the specified user's own private key; User-specific keys and global key: The JWT can be signed with the specified user's own private key or with the global private key. Note: Any user accessing the AoC API using the JWT method must have their public key listed in their AoC user record. The user can enter their own public key, or the AoC administrator can enter the user's public key in the individual user's record. Important! API clients with a global key can retrieve access tokens for and act as any listed user. Use global keys according to local site security practice.","name":"/client_authorizations"},{"description":"Create a workspace (requires an admin token). The workspace is a distinct context in which workspace members can freely share files and send packages. All workspace users of the same type (for example, members or workspace managers) share collaboration settings for that user type. A workspace is a folder on a specific node; the workspace storage is separate from the storage of other workspaces. The workspace contains member users and groups. A workspace may have a workspace manager, who is also a workspace member, that can perform certain administrative function for that specific workspace. (Configure workspace manager using /workspace_memberships).","name":"/workspaces"},{"description":"Use this endpoint to add existing users as members of a workspace, and to update, retrieve, and delete workspace members. An Aspera on Cloud user can be a direct member of a workspace, or can inherit membership by being a member of a user group that is a member of the workspace. This endpoint allows you to add a user or group as a direct member of a workspace. You can also use this endpoint to grant or revoke workspace manager permission to a member (user or group).","name":"/workspace_memberships"},{"description":"A package is a bundle of files and folders (like a ZIP file or TAR file) specified by an AoC user to send to designated recipients. Packages can be sent to individuals, to groups (including to a workspace), or to shared inboxes. Packages can  be sent, received, recalled, archived, deleted. Sending a package can be completed with a user token or with an admin token. The process of sending a package comprises multiple steps. You use the POST, GET, and PUT methods of /packages, along with requests to the Connect API or the Node API.  The folder structure of a package on disk is as follows: {id}.asp-package contains metadata and other package-related files and contains contents, which contains the files and folders in the package. Uploads of package contents should go directly into the named, innermost folder. Downloads of the entire package should be of the named, outermost folder (renamed on download to the package name itself). To get package transfers to properly register, they should be tagged as follows: {\"aspera\": {\"files\": {\"package_id\" : the-package-id}}}.","name":"/packages"},{"description":"A user is anybody using this service.

A report begins at the start of a month (or when usage reporting is enabled) and ends at the beginning of the next month, when a new report is created. An active report for the current month shows  month-to-date usage information, while usage reports for previous months no longer change and show historical data. Due to the way the reporting information is collected, the number of bytes transferred is an approximation and may vary from the actual billed usage if there are transfers that are close to or spanning the changeover between months. NOTE: Usage reports are read-only resources and all attributes are read-only.\n"},{"name":"/organizations","description":"An organization contains all the users, groups, and resources belonging to a real-world organization.
